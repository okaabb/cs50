sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: because its time in sorted is less then merge and selection sort and it O(n-1) times while
                  selection is O(n^2) and merge is O(n log n)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: because it is the fastet in the reversed as it takes the least time than other two sorts
                  as it functions by O(n log n) 

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: because the other two are merge and bubble.
                  but also, because it takes less time in reversed than sort1 which is bubble but not less than merge in sort2
